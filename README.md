# What is Dera?
This is a finetuned BoQ [1] model trained on two different types of data sources for visual place recognition. It is also the name of the city where I was born. :)

The two data sources are:

- Google street view data from around the world which is usually considered GPS-accurate but does not contain much variations of the same place.
- Mapillary data from around the world, which was verified by the author for accuracy using geometric verification with MAST3R and field-of-view overlap. This data is much more diverse than GSV.

Please feel free to use this model under CC BY license.

# How to use this repo?
The file dera.py was used for the croco-dl benchmark. It is compatible with hloc, Lamar, and crocodl pipelines. You can for example copy this to /hloc/extractors/ in the hloc codebase [2]. 

Ofcourse, you can also choose to use the model independent of these pipelines.
